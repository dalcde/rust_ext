We can consider the &quot;$E_1$&quot; page of the Adams spectral sequence, which is three copies of the Adams spectral sequence for the spheres in degrees $0, 8, 12$. Call the generators of the copies $x_0, x_8$ and $x_{12}$.\n To prove this differential, we have to show that in $C\\sigma$, there is a hidden $2$-extension from $h_0^2 h_2 x_8$ to $P h_2 x_0$. If this were true, then since $d_1(x_{12}) = h_2 x_8$, there must be a differential from $h_0^3 x_{12}$ to $P h_2 x_0$. We can write $h_2 x_8 = \\langle \\iota, \\sigma, \\nu \\rangle$, where $\\iota: S^0 \\hookrightarrow C\\sigma$ is the inclusion of the bottom cell. So eight times this is $\\langle \\iota, \\sigma, \\nu \\rangle 8 = \\iota \\langle \\sigma, \\nu, 8\\rangle$. What is left is then a standard Toda bracket calculation in the homotopy groups of spheres.\n Alternatively, one can &quot;cheat&quot; by starting with the differential $d_2(f_0) = h_0^2 e$ in the Adams spectral sequence for the sphere and then propagate backwards along products.","action":{"AddProductDifferential":{"source":{"permanent":false,"x":12,"y":3,"class":[1],"name":"\\alpha"},"target":{"permanent":false,"x":11,"y":5,"class":[1],"name":"h_2 w_1"}}},"sseq":"Main"}
